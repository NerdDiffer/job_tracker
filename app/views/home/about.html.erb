<h3>What is this?</h3>

<p>A job search organizer.</p>
<p>Use it to track applications you've sent out, the companies it was sent to,
people you've spoken with and the status of your applications. Attach any cover
letters or posting to a job application for your reference. Take notes on your
contacts and applications.</p>

<h3>Why would I need this?</h3>

Because you need help tracking your next opportunity.

<h3>How do I get started?</h3>
